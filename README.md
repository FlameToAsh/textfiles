# Files and Miscellaneous 

I am going to use this section of my GitHub to host files that give examples on how to use my product(s). 


## No More Jumpscares
This is a project that hosts a horror and thriller movie DB of timecodes that tell the user when the Jumpscares happen. It is a reboot to a (as of typing in May 2025) defunct website that has been gone since 2023. 

Everything on my app is community driven. From the movies to the timecodes submitted. To make everyone's lives easier I have built a little import tool. Below you will have two files to show you how to properly import. 

NOTE: Multiple movies can be uploaded but the delimiter is a (.) period.
